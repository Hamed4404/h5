OK here's what we need:

Need to update the THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES of this repo (in the root) to include notices for MessagePack + Nerd stuff
Need to ensure that wherever this code ships in also includes a THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES with the content. So whatever NUPKG (or whatever) the code ships in, also needs to include the notices
This is the exact content of the notice (though you may exclude the informational preamble if appending to an existing notice file, such as the one in the root of this repo):

.NET Core uses third-party libraries or other resources that may be
distributed under licenses different than the .NET Core software.

In the event that we accidentally failed to list a required notice, please
bring it to our attention. Post an issue or email us:

           dotnet@microsoft.com
