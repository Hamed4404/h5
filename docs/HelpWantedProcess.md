This document describes the process that the team uses for identifying candidate issues for community members to tackle.

## Process

This process (we'll refer to it as `help-wanted` process going forward) triggers from the moment, when the `help-wanted` label is assigned to an issue.
At that time, the team who is triaging the issue, also assigns an engineer to the issue.
The task for the assigned engineer will be to understand the ask based on all the comments in the issue and summarize the problem in a comment using the [Help Wanted Template](/docs/HelpWantedIssueSummaryCommentTemplate.md).
As part of filling out the template, the engineer will also need to describe a high-level design for how to approach the problem and how it can be solved.
When all the sections of the template are filled in, the user will then need to apply one of the `Complexity: ` labels, to indicate how easy / hard will it be to tackle the issue.
This will help community members to find the right type of issue to contribute to.
After posting this comment, the assigned engineer can unassign themself from the issue.

This will conclude the process.
